## Initial Setup and Improvements {#initial-setup-and-improvements}

\indent The initial off-axis holography setup used to reconstruct phase information is shown in Figure 7. A compact USB laser module is coupled into a single mode fiber (SMF) to ensure spatial mode matching. The beam is collimated to maintain a constant diameter and checked for alignment using a shear plate. A 50:50 beam splitter (BS) then divides the beam into equal-intensity reference and sample beams. The sample beam reflects off a spatial light modulator (SLM) and passes through a 4f system before reaching the camera. The 4f system ensures that the image is focused correctly onto the sensor. The SLM acts as a programmable test object, allowing known phase patterns to be projected. Meanwhile, the reference beam is directed along a separate path to the camera at a slight angle, forming an off-axis inference pattern. A path length matching system with three mirrors is included in the reference beam path to allow adjustment of its optical length, matching it to the sample beam's path.

\indent Two experiments were conducted to optimize the interference pattern: one tested the impact of path length mismatch, and the other tested polarization. For path length, images were taken as the reference beam path was incrementally extended in 5 cm steps. The goal was to identify the distance at which fringe contrast peaked, indicating optimal coherence. For polarization, a rotating polarizer was placed in front of each beam independently. Images were captured at 45o increments, and image intensity was compared to identify the rotation angle at which polarization directions matched.
\indent After testing for the strength of interference, the setup was modified to improve fringe contrast and polarization alignment, as shown in Figure 8. The compact USB laser was replaced with a Helium-Neon (HeNe) laser to increase the coherence length of the system, allowing the difference in path lengths of the two beams to be less precise. A polarizing beam splitter (PBS) was added to divide the beam into sample and reference arms based on polarization directions. A half-wave plate (HWP) was inserted into the reference arm to align its polarization direction with that of the sample beam. These adjustments ensured maximal fringe contrast for high-quality interference. Additional details about the rationale for these modifications are provided in Section #.

## Ben Hartley's MCF Setup {#ben-hartleys-mcf-setup}

\indent To capture the interference between a multicore fiber and a reference beam, the setup designed by Ben Hartley was used, as shown in Fig. 9 @hartleyMCF. In this system, the laser beam first passes through a HWP and a PBS to control polarization. The PBS separates the beam into two orthogonally polarized components, creating the sample and reference beams. Each beam is coupled into a single-mode fiber (SMF).
\indent The reference beam is directed through a series of mirrors to the camera at an angle, creating the necessary off axis configuration for holography. The sample beam passes through two lenses that are arranged to expand the beam size. Unlike a traditional 4f system, these lenses are not placed at their focal lengths. Instead, they are positioned to produce a beam that is larger than the multicore fiber to ensure that the entire diameter is illuminated. After propagating through the fiber, the beam is collected by a microscope objective (MO) and focused onto the camera.
\indent The proximal end of the MCF is attached to a movable platform while the distal end of the MCF is fixed at the MO. This arrangement allows for controlled bending of the fiber. An L-bend consists of rotating the platform and by extension the proximal end of the fiber, side to side. The L-bend geometry is used for the experiment done with this setup, as detailed Section #. Another bend geometry is the U-bend, where the platform and proximal end of the fiber are moved closer to and farther from the distal end of the fiber. The U-bend geometry is discussed in more detail in Section #. By adjusting the bend angle, the phase distortions introduced by the fiber can be studied and quantified using off-axis holography.

\indent A bend experiment was conducted using Ben’s setup to investigate how increasing the bend angle of the multicore fiber affects the reconstructed phase. Images were captured as the proximal end of the fiber was rotated in 10o increments to introduce progressively larger bends. The Fourier domain process described in Section # was used to get the reconstructed phases of each image. These reconstructions contained noticeable noise, primarily due to core-to-core variations in fiber length and magnification. These variations cause slight differences in the way each core is mapped onto the camera. To remove this noise, a reference phase pattern was subtracted from the reconstructed phase. This reference was obtained by reconstructing the phase of a straight MCF. This subtraction removed static phase contributions unrelated to bending, leaving only the phase shift due to bending.
