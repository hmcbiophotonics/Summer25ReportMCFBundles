## In Vivo Imaging Systems {#in-vivo-imaging-systems}
\indent In Vivo Imaging Systems (IVIS) are optical imaging devices used in scientific research to create 2D and 3D representations of biological organisms and processes non-invasively. These systems use advanced imaging techniques, such as bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging, to visualize and track various biological activities within an organism over time. This approach to optical imaging can assist in drug development, understanding disease behaviors, or other biological processes in their natural context @refaat2022in. Most IVIS Imaging methods implement optics in order to extract information about a subject based on the optical properties of the subject and the technique being applied. Many commercial IVIS systems can provide additional capabilities such as X-Ray, temperature control, computed tomography (CT), or accessories @vivo_imaging_system.
